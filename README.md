# Classic-Snake-Game

## Project Description
This is the first project that I have ever posted on Github and it is a mini-game that I made. It is the Classic Snake Game Version 1. The game is mainly developed by using the Pygame library. I also applied the OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in this project to make the code more organized. The updated version of this game will have the actual snake image inside the game instead of moving blocks.

## Installation
